# rock-n-bot
The "Rock'n Bot" dances to music by doing different dance moves depending which frequency had the highest change in amplitude.

Code:
DanceToMusic: At startup, tests the 3 solenoids a couple of times to make sure they are functional. Then, begins the real meat interpretting the music and relaying dance moves as described.

NOTE: Pictures and more in depth descriptions will be uploaded shortly. (right now just uploading all the code for each project)
